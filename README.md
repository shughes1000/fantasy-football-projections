# Fantasy Football Projections

With over 29 million participants in fantasy football, a virtual game based on real-world National
Football League (NFL) player statistics, accurate fantasy point projections are essential. Using
supervised learning, we developed open-source projections trained on historical NFL game data
from 2020 to 2023. After a robust analysis of different modeling techniques, we selected dense
neural networks as our modeling algorithm, yielding a mean absolute error of 4.63 fantasy
points. Feature impact was analyzed using Shapley values, highlighting the importance of
statistics derived from the betting market along with consensus expert rankings. The
transparent, open-source projections provide accurate forecasts of player performance with
interpretable results, showing promise for applications in fantasy football. Future work may
explore projections as a statistical distribution and correlations between teammates to further
refine predictive ability.
